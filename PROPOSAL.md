## Guessing Game
### Description and Motivation
In this project, we are going to building a guessing game with a twist.  In this game, We want to use guessing games, or games of chance, that are alrady well known. More specifically, We want to build a game with other guessing games inside. For example, in a standard guessing game, there is one stage or level so to speak, but in this game the user will have to pass multiple levels of different games. We don't intend to build every well-known guessing game. Our goal for the project is to create a program where users can select the game they want to play and move on with a set number of lives.

### Prior Art
We are rebuilding a game that consist of mini games where the user has to pass different levels that are thrown at them. We are using games that are already invented for example Coin Flip, Guess number 1-10 and Rock, Paper, Scissors. We are taking all these games and when the user completes a level they will be applauded and then sent to the next level. We are taking these concepts and putting them in a single program.

### Core User Workflows
- Game Selection: Since we are using multiple games, we feel as if the user should have a choice in what game they want to play first. This will also allow users to choose what order they play the games in. This allows users to choose their best or worst game first.
- Gameplay: Once the user selects their game, the correct game should then be started. They then attempt to pass through their current level.

### Daily Goals
 - Tuesday: We plan on starting the work off by making the games. We'll make the base games that that requires more code like rock, paper, scissors and guess the number between 1 to 20. We also plan on doing the user input and input validation.
 - Wednesday: We plan on letting the user choose between Rock Paper Scissors, Guess the Number, and Roll the Dice.
 - Thursday: We plan on letting the user choose repeatedly which game they want to play.
