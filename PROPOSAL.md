## Guessing Game
### Description and Motivation
In this project, we are going to building a guessing game with a twist.  In this game, We want to use guessing games, or games of chance, that are alrady well known. More specifically, We want to build a game with other guessing games inside. For example, in a standard guessing game, there is one stage or level so to speak, but in this game the user will have to pass multiple levels of different games. We don't intend to build every well-known guessing game. Our goal for the project is to create a program where users can select the game they want to play and move on with a set number of lives.

### Prior Art
We are rebuilding a game that consist of mini games where the user has to pass different levels that are thrown at them. We are using games that are already invented for example Coin Flip, Guess number 1-10 and Rock, Paper, Scissors. We are taking all these games and when the user completes a level they will be applauded and then sent to the next level. We are taking these concepts and putting them in a single program.
